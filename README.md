This README is to explain the program and terminology that is used within it. The first thing the program is going to do is ask you to select a year or if you want to quit by typing q. 
The Official Pokemon VGC Tournament for the pokemon video game did not take place into 2009. The latest tournamnent was held in 2023. So the program grabs data from each tournament from 
2009-2023 (disregarding 2020 and 2021 due to Covid).

After inputting the year the program will give you an array of four seperate options. The first option (1) being the location of the event which lists the location of the event.

The second option (2) lists the standings for each tournament with the winner and the country from which the winner is from (denoted using Alpha-2 code)

The third option (3) lists the frequency in which each pokemon showed up on teams throughout the top cut (top cut represents the elimination stage of the tournament to determine the winner)
this shows which pokemon were most optimal in their respective years. 

The fourth option (4) goes back to the beginning of the program and asks the user for a year or to quit.

This being my first solo project I wanted to do something I was familar/interested in and use this whole process as a learning experience. I hope you enjoy the program and if you have any
constructive feedback or opinions on what I created or how I could improve it. Those would be very much appreciated.
